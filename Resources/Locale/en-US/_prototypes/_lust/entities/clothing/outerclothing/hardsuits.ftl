    .desc = A high-grade Central Command hardsuit made from the "Axivex" superalloy. Its special structural geometry redistributes stress across the entire suit, reducing localized overloads and overall weight. The integrated Produvatus 3000 thermal loop makes you almost ignore heat and cold at first, though the suit will still soak and build up temperature over time. The result is one of the lightest and most durable hardsuits ever used in space.
